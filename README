	ABOUT
	=====

This is a collection of scripts to help you capture, edit and publish videos
to video hosting services like youtube as well as stream to twitch.tv,
goodgame.ru or similar broadcasting service.


	GETTING STARTED
	===============

The only purpose of these scripts is to provide "glue" between popular
software packages, so before you start make sure you have latest versions of

 - FFmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org/) - very powerful video processing package
   Nothing will work without this, all scripts use it.

 - glgrab (https://github.com/const86/glgrab) - very fast GL grabber
   I recommend this if you want to capture videogames, OpenGL apps or
   DirectX apps under WINE. Keep in mind that "grabbing" part of glgrab
   must match your application's architecture, so you will need 32-bit glgrab
   for 32-bit WINE.
   For other purposes "x11grab" driver for ffmpeg might be sufficient.

 - cinelerra (http://cinelerra.org/) - powerful video editor
   You will probably want to edit your footage before publishing,
   youtuber-utils will provide cinelerra-compatible output.

See also individual scripts for detailed explanation about them.


	PACKAGE CONTENTS

config.sh	Example configuration file. Contains information about your
		setup: device names, grabbing settings, desirable paths.
		Feel free to modify any of these settings, as most of them are
		hardware- or system-specific.

		and visual representation of what will be actually captured.

		store them in files.
